### **Trajectory Tracking Method of Four-wheeled Independent Drive and Steering AGV Based on LSTM-MPC and Fuzzy PID Cooperative Control**  
**Author:** Leonardo Ripple (First Author)  
**Duration:** 09/2024 – 04/2025  
**Publication:** MDPI (Accepted)  

**Abstract:**  
This paper proposes a trajectory tracking control method for a four-wheeled independent drive and steering AGV. The control strategy combines **LSTM-based Model Predictive Control (LSTM-MPC)** for lateral motion prediction and **Fuzzy PID** for longitudinal decoupling, achieving high-precision tracking and strong robustness to nonlinearities.  

**Highlights:**  
- Established a dynamic model of the four-steering-wheel AGV system.  
- Integrated fuzzy PID with MPC to achieve coordinated lateral–longitudinal control.  
- Conducted co-simulation verification on **CARSIM**, **WEBOTS**, and **MATLAB**.  
- Designed and validated the experimental prototype of the four-wheel chassis.
